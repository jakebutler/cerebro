# Cerebro

A curated database of influential Product Management thought leaders, their insights, and contributions to the product community.

## Project Overview
Cerebro is a web application that stores, displays, and verifies a structured dataset of influential people in software product management. The app allows contributors to view, edit, and verify detailed profile data.

## Problem Statement
The product management community relies on the insights of thought leaders, but there is no centralized, verifiable database of these individuals. This makes it difficult to research their contributions and understand the landscape of influence.

## Solution Approach
I built a web application using React, TypeScript, and Convex to provide a real-time, collaborative platform for curating data on PM thought leaders. The application features a clean, intuitive interface for viewing and editing profiles, with a focus on data verification.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Database**: Built on Convex for instant data synchronization.
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time search across all leader data.
- **Add Leader Form**: Community-driven form to suggest new PM thought leaders.
- **Verification Workflow**: A system for flagging and verifying data points.

## Technical Implementation
### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Convex.dev (real-time database and API)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS (TailwindCSS integration planned)

### Code Example
```typescript
// convex/queries.ts
import { query } from "./_generated/server";

export const getLeaders = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("pm_leaders").collect();
  },
});
```

## Lessons Learned
- Convex provides a powerful and easy-to-use backend for real-time applications.
- A well-defined data schema is crucial for maintaining data quality.
- Community-driven data curation requires a robust verification system.

## Future Roadmap
- Integration with TailwindCSS/shadcn-ui for enhanced styling.
- User authentication and permissions.
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities.
